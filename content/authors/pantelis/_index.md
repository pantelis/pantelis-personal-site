I am a recognized industry leader with more than 20 years experience in Research & Development. I started working in wireless communications and went  through many generations of PHY and MAC layer design for 3G, HSPA, LTE and recently 5G mmwave networks. 

I started diversifying into Machine Learning (ML) in the last 10 years initially for optimizing networks where we published groundbreaking papers from field trials, on several use cases associated with automated LTE air-interface parameter optimization and 5G beam-space end-user localization. 

Currently, I am the head of Applied Machine Learning Research at Bell Laboratories, leading ~15 researchers in Murray Hill NJ and Budapest, working in the space of real-time video scene understanding via neuro-symbolic reasoning at the network edge. I have been voting member of the [Acumos project](https://www.acumos.org/) and the technical advisory board of the [Linux Foundation AI (LFAI)](https://lfai.foundation/).

As of Spring 2019 I am also an adjunct with the Computer Science department of NJIT and as of Spring 2020 with NYU, Tandon School of Engineering. I have coauthored 15 journal publications, some with hundreds of citations, and 50 patents issued/pending.
