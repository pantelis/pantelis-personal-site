I am a recognized industry leader with more than 20 years experience in Research & Development. I started working in wireless communications and went  through many generations of PHY and MAC layer design for 3G, HSPA, LTE and recently 5G mmwave networks. 

I started diversifying into Machine Learning (ML) in the last 10 years initially for optimizing networks where we published groundbreaking papers from field trials, on several use cases associated with automated LTE air-interface parameter optimization and 5G beam-space end-user localization. 

Currently, I am Professor of Practice at NJIT teaching data science. I am also working in a wide range of technologies that can significantly impact society. On the open source side,  I have been voting member of the [Acumos project](https://www.acumos.org/) and the technical advisory board of the [Linux Foundation AI (LFAI)](https://lfai.foundation/).

I have coauthored tens of journal publications and patents - I stopped believing in the existing patent system long time back as a result.
