I am a recognized industry leader with more than 20 years experience in leading Research & Development projects. I started in wireless communications in the 90s and in 2000's started diversifying into Machine Learning initially for wireless networks and later for other mission critical applications such as surveilance and robotics. Currently I am the head of Applied Machine Learning Research at Bell Laboratories, leading ~15 researchers in Murray Hill NJ and Budapest. As of Spring 2019 I am also an adjunct with the Computer Science department of NJIT and as of Spring 2020 with NYU, Tandon School of Engineering. 15 journal publications and 50 patents issued/pending.
